# Uso del API de cifrado de JAVA

In this project I simulate a simple time-stamped signature on an exam paper for the teacher to verify its authenticity. There are a lot of things that are not taken into account such as all keys are stored in the same directory. You can see all the simplifications [here](https://github.com/Cibranix/Uso-del-API-de-cifrado-de-JAVA/blob/master/MemoriaJCA_CibranCores.pdf)(in Spanish).
